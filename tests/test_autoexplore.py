"""
Comprehensive tests for autoexplore and related edge case functions.

Tests cover all NetHack4-style autoexplore edge cases:
- Player state checks (blind, confused, stunned, flying, Sokoban, grid bug)
- Dangerous terrain avoidance (water/lava)
- Shop item avoidance
- Boulder handling
- Invisible monster memory
- Vibrating square exception
- Engraving detection
- Dead end detection with boulders
